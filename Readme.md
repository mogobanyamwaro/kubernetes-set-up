Sure! Here's a sample README file that provides an overview of the deployments and services for MongoDB and the web application:

# README

This repository contains the Kubernetes manifests for deploying a MongoDB database and a web application on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured to access the cluster

## Deployment

### MongoDB

1. Create the ConfigMap by running the following command:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f mongo-config.yaml
   ```

2. Create the Secret by running the following command:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f mongo-secret.yaml
   ```

3. Create the MongoDB deployment and service by running the following command:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f mongo-deployment.yaml
   ```

### Web Application

1. Create the web application deployment and service by running the following command:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f webapp-deployment.yaml
   ```

2. Accessing the Web Application

   - To access the web application within the cluster, you can use the service name `webapp-service`.
   - To access the web application from outside the cluster, use the `<Minikube IP>:30100`, where `<Minikube IP>` is the IP address of your Minikube cluster. You can retrieve the IP address by running the command `minikube ip`.

## Configuration

- The MongoDB deployment uses the `mongo-secret` secret for authentication credentials. Make sure to update the `mongo-user` and `mongo-password` values in the `mongo-secret.yaml` file with your desired credentials. The current values are base64-encoded.
- The web application deployment uses the `mongo-secret` secret for the MongoDB authentication credentials and the `mongo-config` ConfigMap for the MongoDB URL. You can customize these values by updating the respective keys in the `webapp-deployment.yaml` file.
